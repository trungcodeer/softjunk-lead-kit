# Shareable Order Link Checkpoint

Current todo:
- Commit, push, release, and verify Pages deployment.
- Submit discovery pings.
- Rerun PayPal verification gate.

Active slice:
- Deployment and payment-gate verification.

Completed todos:
- Read continuation summary.
- Read baseline product and root status.
- Read accessibility and long-task-continuation guidance.
- Added `shareable-order-link.html`, `.json`, and `.txt`.
- Wired the new route into product pages, product discovery manifests, root hub pages, root JSON, root sitemap, and OpenAPI discovery.
- Parsed product JSON/XML and root JSON/XML successfully.
- Parsed the page's inline JavaScript with Node.

Evidence refs:
- `git status --short --branch` was clean for product and root repos before edits.
- Baseline files were read before this checkpoint.
- `ConvertFrom-Json` over product/root JSON completed successfully.
- XML parse over product/root sitemaps and product RSS completed successfully.
- `node -e` inline script parse returned `script ok 1`.

Blocked-on items:
- PayPal seller-side credentials or CSV proof are still required to verify actual payment.

Next step:
- Commit and push both repos, wait for GitHub Pages, submit IndexNow, then rerun PayPal verifier.

DriftCheckDraft:
- Original task intent: earn $5 ethically through owned public assets and only stop when PayPal evidence exists.
- Current slice fit: yes, it creates a higher-conversion owned order handoff.
- Compatibility boundary: static GitHub Pages, PayPal.Me, manual fulfillment gate.
- Decision: continue.
